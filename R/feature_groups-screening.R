#' @details \code{groupFeaturesScreening} uses results from \code{screenSuspects}
#'   to transform an existing \code{\link{featureGroups}} object by (1) renaming
#'   any matched feature groups by the respective name of the suspect and (2)
#'   filtering out any feature groups that were not matched. A common workflow
#'   is to first obtain and group features (with \emph{e.g.}
#'   \code{\link{findFeatures}} and \code{\link{groupFeatures}}), screen them
#'   with \code{screenSuspects}, convert the \code{featureGroups} object that was
#'   used for screening with this method function and continue any further
#'   workflow steps such as compound identification as with 'regular'
#'   \code{featureGroups}.
#'
#' @param fGroups The \code{\link{featureGroups}} object that should be
#'   transformed (and was used to obtain the screening results).
#' @param scr The screening results table returned by \code{screenSuspects}.
#'
#' @return \code{groupFeaturesScreening} returns a modified \code{featureGroups}
#'   object in which those feature groups that were not matched by any suspects
#'   are removed and others renamed by the respective suspect name. In case of
#'   duplicate suspect results, feature group names are made unique with
#'   \code{\link{make.unique}}.
#'
#' @note Please note that \code{groupFeaturesScreening} method can only
#'   transform the \code{featureGroups} object that was used to obtain the given
#'   screening results.
